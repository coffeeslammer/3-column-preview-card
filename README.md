# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

## Overview

This one seemed straightforward. The only issue I had was the buttons. When I hover over the button the border added size so the bottom would drop just that slight bit which was annoying. The fix was I decreased the padding to match the border. Seems like a hack, should be able to do negative values.
